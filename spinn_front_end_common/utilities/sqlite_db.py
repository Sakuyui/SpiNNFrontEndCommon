class SQLiteDB(AbstractContextManager):
    """
    General support class for SQLite databases. This handles a lot of the
    low-level detail of setting up a connection.

    Basic usage (with the default row type)::

        with SQLiteDB("db_file.sqlite3") as db:
            with db.transaction() as cursor:
                for row in cursor.execute("SELECT thing FROM ..."):
                    print(row["thing"])

    This class is designed to be either used as above or by subclassing.
    See the `SQLite SQL documentation <https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html>`_ for
    details of how to write queries, and the Python :py:mod:`sqlite3` module
    for how to do parameter binding.

    .. note::
        If you plan to use the WAL journalling mode for the DB, you are
        *recommended* to set this up in the DDL file via::

            PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;

        This is because the journal mode is persistent for database.
        For details, see the
        `SQLite documentation <https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html>`_ on
        the write-ahead log.
